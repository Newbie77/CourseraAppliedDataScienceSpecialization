Certificate: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/HGME8JYVA4EW

### Week 1

Learning Objectives:</br>
- Choose a graphic that displays misleading information</br>
- Interpret the features of the graphic in order to identify the mechanism(s) that is/are used by the "encoder" to mislead the "decoder"</br>
- Analyze the graphic and use principles from Alberto Cairo's work to explain how the graphic is misleading</br>
- Create a radar plot in order to reflect on the complexity of the misleading graphic</br>

Assignment:Assignment 1 - Graphics Lies, Misleading Visuals <br>

### Week 4:
Learning Objectives</br>
- Identify two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension</br>
- State a research question that can be answered using two publicly accessible datasets</br>
- Create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question</br>
- Justify how the visual addresses your research question</br>
