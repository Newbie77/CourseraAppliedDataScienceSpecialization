    "For this assignment, you will read Alberto Cairo's work, [Graphics Lies, Misleading Visuals](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/readings/Cairo2015.pdf). <br>\n",
    "You will locate and identify a visual that displays misleading information. You will interpret the features of the visual in order to identify the mechanism(s) that is/are used by the \"encoder\" to mislead the \"decoder.\" For each mechanism that you identify, you will explain how it was used to mislead.<br>\n",

You might also want to consider looking on the subreddits dataisbeautiful or dataisugly. Be creative in your search!*\n",

    "*1. Identify the specific component(s) of the visual that is/are misleading* <br>\n",

    "Itâ€™s confusing how many percent one book equals to: comparing second and third pile we can derive that 3% equals to 5 book which is 0.6% per book, while if we compare third and fourth piles 1% equals to 4 books which is 0.25% per book.\n",

    "3. By removing the zero on a chart, the difference between periods looks much bigger than it actually is, if the same data would be mapped on a chart with zero visible than the growth of the graduation rate would look more flat.\n",
    "Usage of the books to illustrate percentage would help the viewers to remember the topic that the chart is supposed to represent but it misleads to think that the change between time periods is more dramatic than it is."
